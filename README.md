# SC1015-Miniproject-Submission
## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015  which focuses on netflix & the price of difference subscription prices in different countries:

1. [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/terenceohyz/SC1015-Miniproject-Submission/blob/main/Codes/Datacleaning.ipynb)
2. [Data Exploration](https://github.com/terenceohyz/SC1015-Miniproject-Submission/tree/main/Codes)
4. [Regression](https://github.com/terenceohyz/SC1015-Miniproject-Submission/blob/main/Codes/KNearestNeighbour.ipynb)
5. [K-Nearest Neighbours](https://github.com/terenceohyz/SC1015-Miniproject-Submission/blob/main/Codes/Regression.ipynb)

- Chin Kian Hwee - Linear Regression, GDP Slides- Linear Regression, Conclusion

## Problem Definition

- How are the prices of various Netflix subscriptions determined in a country?
- Are we able to predict the prices with just GDP & Population Density?

## Models Used

1. Linear Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbours Regression

## Conclusion

- Library Size & Population Density has an extremely low correleation with netflix prices
- GDP per capita has a heavy influence on pricing of Netflix Subscriptions
- Regession only able to predict to a certain extent with low accuracy due to many other factors affecting the pricing
- The more premium the subscription plan, the higher correleation it has to the country's GDP per capita
- Businesses that operate internationally do solely depend on income of the country but many other factors such as taxes, government or competition

## What did we learn from this project?

- Efficient ways to clean data and export out csv
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Ridge Regression & Linear Regression
- The concept behind purchasing power parity & international business pricing
- Using Github
- Data Exploration
